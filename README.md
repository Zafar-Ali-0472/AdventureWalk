# AdventureWalk
The AdventureWalk Game is a mobile game where the player controls BhaiJan, who walks along a road, collecting candies and avoiding birds. The game uses GPS to detect player movement, so BhaiJan walks only when the player walks. The objective is to collect as many candies as possible while avoiding birds to keep BhaiJan's health above zero.
